# Changing Names Of Enum Variants And Functions

Consider the grammar below:

```text
S: A A
  | A A A
  | A A A A
  ;

terminals

A: 'a';
```

Grammar rule `S` will be converted to:

```rust
pub enum S {
    C1,
    C2,
    C3,
}

pub fn s_c1(_ctx: &Ctx) -> S { /* ... */ }
pub fn s_c2(_ctx: &Ctx) -> S { /* ... */ }
pub fn s_c3(_ctx: &Ctx) -> S { /* ... */ }
```

We see enum variants `C1`, `C2` and `C3`, and functions `s_c1`, `s_c2` and `s_c3` as well.
These names are generated by `rcomp` and do not make much sense to us.
Instead, we can specify a name for each production.

```text
S: A A {Double}
  | A A A {Triple}
  | A A A A {Quadruple}
  ;

terminals

A: 'a';
```

We put a name surrounded by braces after each production.
Now, `rcomp` uses the names given by us for the enum variants and action functions.

```rust
pub enum S {
    Double,
    Triple,
    Quadruple,
}

pub fn s_double(_ctx: &Ctx) -> S { /* ... */ }
pub fn s_triple(_ctx: &Ctx) -> S { /* ... */ }
pub fn s_quadruple(_ctx: &Ctx) -> S { /* ... */ }
```

This makes the action file more readable.
