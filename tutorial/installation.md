# Installation

To generate a parser, we will need an executable `rcomp`, which is a part of [Rustemo](https://github.com/igordejanovic/rustemo) project.
`rcomp` can be installed by [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html):

```sh
cargo install rustemo-compiler
```

We can find the executable `rcomp` in `~/.cargo/bin`.
