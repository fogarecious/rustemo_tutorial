# Default Actions For Grammar Rules

Recall that each production of a grammar rule has a corresponding `fn` in the action file.
The `fn` describes the action that will be taken when a substring of the input is parsed according to the production.

Let us look at an example.

```text
S: A | B;

terminals

A: 'a';
B: 'b';
```

The `fn`s of production `A` and `B` are:

```rust
pub fn s_a(_ctx: &Ctx) -> S {
    S::A
}

pub fn s_b(_ctx: &Ctx) -> S {
    S::B
}
```

These `fn`s are generated by `rcomp` automatically and thus perform the default action, which returns the corresponding variant of the `enum`.

```rust
pub enum S {
    A,
    B,
}
```
